I started with a base navbar plus a css format. from there I used a two column set up for the base structure.
I began inserting the Images and the text but there was a problem where the second column went under the first.
I don't remember how I fixed that issue(Probably css manipulation). but I did get it fixed.
I used javascript to cycle through images to give it that product page feel. 
I added small versions of the images in square containers to cycle the images from.
At some point I applied the logo to the navbar.
I would use css to make sure the items take their desired locations and sizes.
